# Tic-Tac-Toe
A game of Tic Tac Toe!

There are two files in this program. One is a normal game of tic tac toe, where the program
first asks for a board size, and then players alternatively put in their moves until the game is up.

The second file will run input files, to test if every case of the main game systems work.
