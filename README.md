# Tic-Tac-Toe
A game of Tic Tac Toe!

There are a few files in this program. 

One is toe.cpp, or a normal game of tic tac toe, where the program 
	first asks for a board size, and then players alternatively put in 
	their moves until the game is up. You can also pick a board size,
	from 3 to 5.

The second file, toecheck.cpp, will run input files, to test if every 
	case of the main game systems work. You cannot play this one, just 
	input another file into it.
	
CH01 is a collection of files, designed to answer the question: is this 
	input board the right size? You can find out by running the following 
	command. 
	
	./solution [size of the board] < input[file number you'd like to try]
